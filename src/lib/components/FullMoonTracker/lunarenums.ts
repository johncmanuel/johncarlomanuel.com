// Moon phases are same in both hemipsheres; however, the angles are flipped.
// For example, if the current moon phase is a last quarter, the visible moon is on the right side.
// But in the southern hemisphere, the visible moon is on the left side.
// Source: https://science.nasa.gov/moon/top-moon-questions/
// Though for implementation,
// it is not possible to determine the user's hemisphere without the use of geolocation. I would not
// want to use geolocation to keep website permissions as low as possible
