        Software engineer and computer science student at California State University, Fullerton.
        I'm interested in full-stack development, game development, and distributed systems. Outside
        of engineering, I enjoy diving into creative endeavors such as writing and worldbuilding.
        I'm also a cool gamer that mainly plays (MMO)RPGs and narrative-driven games.
